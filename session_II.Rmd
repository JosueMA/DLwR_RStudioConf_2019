## Learning Goals

Developing deep learning to two core questions in supervised learning: Classification and Regression. 

The UCI Abalone data-set is a small and easy starting point since it can be used for predicting age as either a categorical or continuous variable, leading to the 

## Outline

- The training, validation and test sets.
- Four ways of dealing with over-fitting: more data, capacity, dropout, regularization.
- The universal workflow of machine learning.
- Introduction to tfruns package.
- Evalutating models with `tfruns`.
