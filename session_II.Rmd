## Learning Goals

Refine deeep learning models. 

## Outline

- The training, validation and test sets.
- Four ways of dealing with over-fitting: more data, capacity, dropout, regularization.
- The universal workflow of machine learning.
- Introduction to tfruns package.
- Evalutating models with `tfruns`.
